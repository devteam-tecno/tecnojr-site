# ============================================
# RESEND EMAIL SERVICE
# ============================================
# Required for: Production runtime ONLY
# NOT required for: Local dev, build, tests, CI/CD
# 
# The contact form API uses lazy initialization - Resend is only
# instantiated when the API route is called, not during build time.
# This allows builds to succeed without the API key configured.

# Resend API Key for email functionality
# Get your API key from: https://resend.com/api-keys
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Default sender email (must be verified in Resend)

# Recommended: contato@tecnojr.com.br (for forms/API)
